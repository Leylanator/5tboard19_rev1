This is a prototype handwired project using a Pro Micro (Atmega32u4).
If you don't want to alter anything, I recommend soldering the columns and rows the exact way the schematic assumes.

* Keyboard Maintainer: [LEYLA](https://github.com/Leylanator)
* Hardware Supported: Arduino Pro Micro (Atmega32u4
* What you will need for this project: 1× Pro Micro, 1× Reset Switch, 19× Keyswitches, 1× Custom Plate* , 1× GH60 Case.

* I provide .dxf CAD files for the plate, it will fit GH60 (standard 60%) cases, and will support multiple keyswitch footprints - such as Cherry MX1A, ALPS SKCM, Kailh Choc 2, etc.

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make handwired/5tboard19_rev1:default

Flashing example for this keyboard:

    make handwired/5tboard19_rev1:default:flash

## Bootloader

Enter the bootloader in 3 ways:

* **Bootmagic reset**: Hold down the key at (0,0) in the matrix (usually the top left key or Escape) and plug in the keyboard
* **Physical reset button**: Briefly press the button on the back of the PCB - some may have pads you must short instead
* **Keycode in layout**: Press the key mapped to `QK_BOOT` if it is available
